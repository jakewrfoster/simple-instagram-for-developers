Simple Instagram for Developers
===============================
1) <b>important : <em>Obtain a Client ID from the Instagram API</em></b>

2) Enter the Client ID along with the User ID of the feed you would like to display on your wordpress install in the plugin settings

3) echo the shortcode "[fd_simple_instagram]" in your template

4) Style to your heart's content

In the future I will be adding slideshow options (using Flexslider), advanced error handling as well as better support from the options page (for those who may need help obtaining the proper info from the Instagram API)
